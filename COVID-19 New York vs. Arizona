## Importing Data
Johns Hopkins COVID 19 data imported in a reproducible manner. This is the link to the data `url_in`, `file_names` includes a list of the file names, and `urls` include the complete links to the data. The data is labeled `US_cases` and `US_deaths`. `UID_lookup` is imported so we can use the population data.
```{r get_jhu_data}
url_in <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/"
file_names <- c("time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv", "time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv")
UID_lookup <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/UID_ISO_FIPS_LookUp_Table.csv")

urls <- str_c(url_in,file_names)
US_cases <- read.csv(urls[1])
US_deaths <- read.csv(urls[2])
```

## United States Data Tidied and Transformed
Here the date, cases, and deaths are placed in their own columns. Cases and deaths are joined in `US`. Additionally dates are reformatted. These have an 'X' in front of them and can be removed using the substring method. Population data was also added. This section includes both summaries of the US cases and deaths data. The data here is grouped by state. There is also an added column which includes both `new_cases` and `new_deaths` totals per day.

```{r tidy_us_data, message=FALSE}
US_cases <- US_cases %>% pivot_longer(cols = -(UID:Combined_Key), names_to = "date", values_to ="cases") %>% select(Admin2:cases) %>% mutate(date = mdy(substring(date,2))) %>% select(-c(Lat,Long_))

US_deaths <- US_deaths %>% pivot_longer(cols = -(UID:Population), names_to = "date", values_to ="deaths") %>% select(Admin2:deaths) %>% select(-c(Lat,Long_)) %>% mutate(date = mdy(substring(date,2))) 

US <- US_cases %>% full_join(US_deaths)

US_by_state <- US %>% group_by(Province_State,Country_Region,date) %>% summarize(cases=sum(cases),deaths=sum(deaths),Population=sum(Population)) %>% select(Province_State,Country_Region,date,cases,deaths,Population) %>% ungroup()

US_by_state <- US_by_state %>% mutate(new_cases = cases-lag(cases), new_deaths = deaths-lag(deaths))

US_totals <- US_by_state %>% group_by(Country_Region,date) %>% summarize(cases=sum(cases),deaths=sum(deaths),Population=sum(Population)) %>% ungroup()

US_totals <- US_totals %>% mutate(new_cases = cases-lag(cases), new_deaths = deaths-lag(deaths))
```

Summary of the data is shown for proof.
```{r summary2}
summary(US_by_state) 
```
## United States Cases vs Deaths Visualization
A graph of U.S. cases and deaths is plotted on a log-scale. It appears the growth rate of cases and deaths converge over time.
```{r visuals_US}
US_totals %>% filter(cases > 0) %>% ggplot(aes(x=date,y=cases)) + geom_line(aes(color="cases")) + geom_point(aes(color="cases")) + geom_line(aes(y=deaths,color="deaths")) + geom_point(aes(y=deaths,color="deaths")) + scale_y_log10() + theme(legend.position = "bottom", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + labs(title = "COVID19 in US", y=NULL)
```

## Arizona vs New York Data Visualization
Here Arizona and New York data are compared against one another. The data shows New York had significantly more cases in early 2022. The data also shows that Arizona did not consistantly record data starting in the middle of 2022. Data is missing dates in both data sets. This may be the result of a change in data recording policies.
```{r visuals_AZvNY_new_cases}
AZvsNY <- US_by_state %>% filter(Province_State=="Arizona" | Province_State=="New York") %>% filter(cases>0)

ggplot(data=AZvsNY,aes(x=date,y=new_cases)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  facet_wrap("Province_State") +
  labs(title="Comparing New Cases in Arizona vs New York")
```

Here Arizona and New York are again compared against one another. The data here shows deaths over the time during the Covid-19 pandemic. New York had significantly more total deaths in the middle of 2020 and the death rate in Arizona was significantly less than the death rate in New York. However, there seems to be missing dates in both data sets here as well. Once again this may be the result of changing data recording policies.
```{r visuals_AZvNY_deaths}
ggplot(data=AZvsNY,aes(x=date,y=new_deaths)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  facet_wrap("Province_State") +
  labs(title="Comparing New Cases in Arizona vs New York")
```

Again cases in Arizona are compared against cases in New York. Here we compare a proportion of the state population in an attempt to identify correlation. A linear model was made to compare the state cases as a proportion of their populations over time. It appears there is a high correlation with an R-squared of 0.98. 
```{r visuals_AZvNY_case_basis}
AZ <- AZvsNY %>% filter(Province_State=="Arizona") %>% mutate(basis = cases/Population)
NY <- AZvsNY %>% filter(Province_State=="New York")  %>% mutate(basis = cases/Population)

newAZvsNY <- merge(AZ, NY, by = "date") 
mod <- lm(basis.x ~ basis.y, data = newAZvsNY)
summary(mod)

preds <- newAZvsNY %>% mutate(pred = predict(mod))

preds %>%
ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x = basis.x, y = basis.y, color = "Raw Data")) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = basis.x, y = pred, color = "Prediciton")) + 
  labs(title = "Correlation COVID-19 Cases on Population Basis: NY vs AZ") +
labs(y = "NY Daily Cases/Population", x = "AZ Daily Cases/Population", color = "Legend")

```


## Possible Biases
The analysis conducted in this report was not free from biases. A major bias that has been noted throughout this report are data collection methods. Arizona and New York may have collected data differently and for different lengths of time. This could have negatively impacted the findings of the report. It is possible that data collection methods could have been influenced by each states political policies. Additionally, both data sets were missing data. It is possible that the missing data was exclueded for different reasons in one state than in the other. Therefore, the data set in one state may have included or excluded data that would be considered valid in the other state. This too could have negatively impacted the findings of this report. Future studies might be interested in comparing states with similarly sized urban and rural population to determine if population density may have had an impact on Covid-19 data.
